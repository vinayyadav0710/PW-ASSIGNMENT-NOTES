3.Write a short note on tags, elements, and attributes along with relevant examples.
Ans
Tag:-

HTML tags are what defines where an HTML element starts and where it ends. There is usually an opening bracket followed by the elementâ€™s name and, finally, a closing bracket.
In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag enclosing an element. Nevertheless, that is not the case for all elements.
As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag. It contains two opposite angle brackets.  
Examples: <title></title>
	  <p></p>
	  <b></b> 

Elements:-

When it comes to HTML elements, these are the building blocks of this language. Each element is an individual component on a particular web page or document. They are in every part of the page, including the header, footer, body, and text.
The format of a tag is a start tag followed by the content and an end tag, eventually. For instance, if you need to use a paragraph element, here is the way to go.

Example: <b>some written texts here</b>

Attributes:-

In simple words, an HTML attribute is what modifies an HTML element. It is usually in the form of unique words that one inserts inside the opening tag. They control the behavior of the element that follows.
Every tag has two sections. The first one is usually the name of the attribute, while the other one is its value. The two are usually separated by an equals sign (=). Attributes are inside the start tag of that particular element that needs modification.
One can enclose the value of the attribute using either double or single quotes. In some cases where there is the usage of certain characters, quoting may not be necessary. It is good to note that the rules may be different when it comes to other languages, including the sister one, XHTML.
However, experts have rules unquoted attribute values to be unsafe. Equally important, not all attributes need values. A good example is an ismap attribute, which modifies the img element. The general structure of an attribute is as follows:

Examples:<a href="home.html"></a>
