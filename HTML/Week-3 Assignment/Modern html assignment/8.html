        <h1>WHAT IS SEMANTIC HTML</h1>
        <p>Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in web pages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents.</p>

            <li>&lt;header&gt;: This tag represents the introductory content or a group of introductory content in a web page. It typically contains the website's logo, navigation menus, headings, and other elements related to the top section of the page.</li>
            <li>&lt;nav&gt;: The &lt;nav&gt; tag denotes a section of the page that contains navigation links. It is used to define a block of navigation elements, such as menus or lists of links, allowing users to move between different pages or sections within the website.</li>
            <li>&lt;main&gt;: The &lt;main&gt; tag represents the main content of a document or webpage. It should typically contain unique content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of the page. Each page should ideally have only one <main> tag.</li>
            <li>&lt;article&gt;: The &lt;article&gt; tag defines a self-contained piece of content that is meant to be independently distributable or reusable. It could be a blog post, news article, forum post, or any other stand-alone content item.</li>
            <li>&lt;footer&gt;: The &lt;footer&gt; tag is used to mark the footer or the bottom section of a webpage. It typically contains information about the author, copyright notices, contact details, and links to related documents or resources.</li>
