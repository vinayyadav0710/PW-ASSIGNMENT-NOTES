
1. What is a Database? Explain with an exmple on why shoud we need a database.

Ans.	A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. 
	Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in an efficient manner. 
	They are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), which provide the tools and interfaces necessary for users to interact with the data.

	Eaxample:-
	Imagine a small business, such as an online bookstore, that needs to manage various aspects of its operations:

	Inventory Management: Keeping track of the books in stock, their prices, and descriptions.
	Customer Information: Storing customer details like names, addresses, and purchase history.
	Order Processing: Recording orders, payment statuses, and shipping details.
	Supplier Information: Managing information about book suppliers, including contact details and transaction history.

2. Write a short note on file base storage system. Explain the major challenges of a file-base storage system.

Ans.	A file-based storage system organizes and stores data in individual files within a hierarchical directory structure. 
	Each file is a self-contained unit of data, managed by the operating system.

	Major Challenges:
	
	1.Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:
		Duplicate data across multiple files can lead to inconsistencies and wasted storage.
	
	2.Data Integrity:

7.Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.

Ans. The three-schema architecture, also known as the ANSI/SPARC architecture, is a framework for database systems.
     It divides the database structure into three levels: internal, conceptual, and external. 
     This separation helps in data abstraction, making database management more efficient and user-friendly.

	1. Internal Schema (Physical Level)
		Description: The internal schema describes the physical storage of data on storage devices. It includes details about data storage structures, access paths, and indexing.
		Advantages:
			Performance Optimization: Allows for the optimization of database performance by fine-tuning storage and access mechanisms.
			Data Independence: Changes at this level do not affect the higher levels, providing physical data independence.
			Efficient Storage Management: Facilitates efficient management of disk space and resources.
	2. Conceptual Schema (Logical Level)
		Description: The conceptual schema represents the logical structure of the entire database as seen by the database administrator. It defines what data is stored, the relationships between data items, and constraints on the data.
		Advantages:
			Data Abstraction: Provides a unified view of the entire database without considering the physical storage details.
			Data Integrity and Consistency: Ensures consistency and integrity constraints are maintained across the database.
			Simplified Management: Easier to manage data security, integrity, and constraints at this centralized level.
	3. External Schema (View Level)
		Description: The external schema defines how individual users or applications view the data. Each external schema provides a tailored view of the database suited to the specific needs of different users.
		Advantages:
			User-Specific Views: Allows customization of data views for different users, enhancing usability and security.
			Security: Restricts access to sensitive data by providing user-specific views that expose only the necessary data.
			Logical Data Independence: Changes to the conceptual schema do not affect the external schemas, providing logical data independence.


	Advantages of Three-Schema Architecture:

		1.Data Independence:
			Physical Data Independence: Changes at the internal level do not affect the conceptual or external levels.
			Logical Data Independence: Changes to the conceptual schema do not affect external schemas.
		
		2.Enhanced Security:
			Different views (external schemas) ensure that users access only the data they are authorized to see, protecting sensitive information.

		3.Improved Data Management:
			Clear separation of concerns makes the database easier to design, manage, and maintain. It simplifies updates and maintenance tasks without disrupting user operations.
